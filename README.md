### Build Visual AI Workflows with Python
LLM workbench built fully in Python with a web frontend made possible by Panel. Run locally or deploy to a server with ease.

Extensibility and modularity are first-class citizens.

Comes with a wide set of self-contained components called **Elements**, which contain the business and display logic. For example: LLM Model, Chat Interface, Context Handler

They are extensible and modifiable with a clear and straight-forward interface.

Each element may contain collections of input and output ports which enable the flow of data between them. Inspired by LangChain and built with it.
