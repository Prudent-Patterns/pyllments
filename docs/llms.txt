Motivation:
Pyllments was built to unify UI, state management, and LLM orchestration into a single reactive, flow-based framework, eliminating fragmented boilerplate and accelerating development of interactive LLM applications.

Synopsis:
Pyllments is a Python library enabling developers to assemble modular pipelines that integrate large language models with customizable frontends and APIs. Each pipeline is constructed from Elementsâ€”self-contained Components that encapsulate a Param-driven Model (logic and state), optional Panel-based Views (UI), and Ports (InputPort/OutputPort) for defining data flows. Payloads, also Components, wrap data exchanged between Elements, while the FlowController Element provides callback-based orchestration across multiple ports. Prebuilt recipes and a CLI offer ready-to-run applications like chat interfaces, branching flows, and multi-agent orchestrations.

Core Concepts:
- Element: A modular unit combining Model, Views, and Ports for a specific function.
- Payload: A Component that carries data through Ports and can render itself via Views.
- Port: Endpoints (InputPort, OutputPort) following an observer pattern for reactive messaging.
- FlowController: An advanced Element that orchestrates complex workflows via a user-defined flow_map.
- Recipe: A parameterized, CLI-exposed application template located in `pyllments/recipes`.

Project Structure:
- `pyllments/base/`: Core abstractions (ComponentBase, ElementBase, ModelBase, PayloadBase).
- `pyllments/elements/`: Built-in Elements organized by functionality (chat_interface, router, transformer, etc.).
- `pyllments/ports/`: Definitions and management of Port classes.
- `pyllments/runtime/`: Execution infrastructure (event loop registry, scheduler).
- `pyllments/recipes/`: CLI-ready recipes for common LLM workflows.
- `cli/`, `serve/`, `templates/`: Modules for CLI integration, deployment, and code generation.

Key Dependencies:
- Param: Defines reactive, type-validated parameters and automatic callbacks.
- Panel: Builds and styles interactive UI components.
- asyncio & loguru: Underpin FlowController concurrency and structured logging.

Design Principles:
- Flow-Based Composition: Connect Elements to form directed graphs of data flow.
- Reactivity: Leverage Param for automatic state and view updates.
- Modularity & Extensibility: Encapsulate functionality in reusable Elements and Payloads.
- Developer-Focused: Intuitive APIs, minimal boilerplate, and comprehensive documentation.

Available Elements:
- ChatInterfaceElement: Manages chat UI components (input area, feed, send button) and message display/emission.
- LLMChatElement: Interfaces with LLM providers to generate responses to incoming MessagePayloads.
- APIElement: Exposes application ports as REST API endpoints using FastAPI and aggregates payloads into responses.
- Router: Routes incoming payloads to different outputs based on configurable predicates.
- StructuredRouterTransformer: Validates and routes structured JSON payloads via Pydantic schemas and transforms data fields.
- TransformElement: Applies custom transformation functions to incoming payloads and emits outputs.
- ContextBuilderElement: Aggregates and orders message payloads from multiple sources, constants, and templates to build chat context.
- MCPElement: Implements the Model Context Protocol to provide tools schemas and manage tool calls within flows.
- PipeElement: Testing utility for piping payloads into and out of flows, capturing and emitting arbitrary data.
- TelegramElement: Enables Telegram chat interactions, forwarding messages between Telegram and application ports.
- DiscordElement: Enables Discord DM interactions, forwarding messages between Discord and application ports.
- HistoryHandlerElement: Manages storage and retrieval of message history as a persistent flow of MessagePayloads.
