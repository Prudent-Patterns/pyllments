This element is the backbone of flows involving user interaction through the browser by offering multiple Views you are able to compose to create your chat interface, including an input area, chat feed, and send button.
It provides the essential component of user interaction through receiving `MessagePayloads` and `ToolsResponsePayloads`, generating `MessagePayloads` as responses, as well as granting tool call permission to received `ToolsResponsePayloads`.
