[ports.py](mdc:pyllments/ports/ports.py)

Ports are part of an element. They are created within Elements to facilitate communication between other elements.
Input ports receive payloads, and tend to trigger some internal process within the Element's model. Sometimes this results in a payload being emitted from an output port(not always).

## Port naming convention:
Input ports:
 - Input ports that do not trigger an output port to emit something *_input
 - Input ports that do trigger an output port to emit something *_emit_input
